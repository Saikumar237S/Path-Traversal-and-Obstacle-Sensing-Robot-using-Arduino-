# Path Traversal and Obstacle Sensing Robot using Arduino

This repository contains the published project paper titled **"Path Traversal and Obstacle Sensing Robot using Arduino"**, presented as part of our academic work at B.V. Raju Institute of Technology.

## 📄 Project Overview

This project focuses on designing a robot that can:
- Follow a predefined path using infrared (IR) sensors
- Detect and avoid obstacles in real-time using ultrasonic sensors
- Navigate intelligently without human intervention

The system was built using an Arduino Uno, DC motors, and low-cost sensors. It demonstrates a working model of autonomous robotic movement, adaptable to various indoor environments.

## 👨‍💻 My Contributions

- Wrote and tested Arduino code for motor control and sensor logic
